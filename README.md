Regular Fat products dominate sales, but Low Fat is also a strong performer.

Fruits, Vegetables, and Snack Foods are the top-selling categories.

Seafood & Breakfast items have very low sales, signaling potential areas for improvement or promotions.

Boosting low-performing categories (Seafood, Breakfast)

Leveraging high-demand Tier 3 markets

Optimizing item visibility for Grocery stores
